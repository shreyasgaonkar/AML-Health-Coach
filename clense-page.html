                The autumn equinox is a time of balance between day and night, before night takes over to bring winter. Trees turn vibrant colors of gold, red and brown before falling off to the earth. Following the cues of nature, it is a good time to reflect inwards and ask ”What is it that I need to let go off?”

            <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
            <p>
                The Autumn Mind and Body Cleanse is a 14-day program that will give your body the proper nutrition and rest it needs to clear away the lingering toxins and help you lose weight, gain energy, and feel fantastic. This is a whole food program. No juicing. No starving. You will learn how your body reacts to food, and how to use your intuition to feed it right. We will teach you about how to use food to help heal yourself. We won’t be selling you supplements, but we will introduce you to a few of our favorites that we think are key to supporting your systems as you detoxify.
