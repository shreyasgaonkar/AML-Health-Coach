      <p>"Working with April came at a time when I was going through major transitions in my career and personal life, and I am extremely thankful to have had her support during this period.  She was extremely dedicated and gave me an enormous amount of helpful and insightful information for my particular situation.  With her and her advice and encouragement, I was able to work towards my personal, professional and health goals.  She has a very holistic approach and caters to one's individual situation using her own experiences and vast knowledge of how to be a well rounded and healthy person.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>I had never considered working with a health coach before working with her, but am thankful I did because it was the motivation and foundation I needed to begin my path of becoming a healthier person inside and out.  I highly recommend April- she is dedicated, knowledgeable and passionate." <br />

      <p>"The coaching with April has been really life-changing, like a godsend. She understood what I needed right away and helped me feel better after years of getting up dreading each day because my mind and body were suffering and I felt like crap all of the time. I appreciate her ability to listen, and motivate me to make changes that I can actually stick to.  It's huge how she coached me to not just lose 30 lbs but finally keep it off and completely transform my eating, exercise and lifestyle habits.  I have finally learned to love myself and body!" <br /> <strong>  Stephanie, 30, Marketing Consultant</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>"I learned so much about myself as I worked with April to achieved my personal health goals.  Her understanding and expertise guided me on my journey of replacing the junk with healthy foods, getting in shape and welcoming mindfulness into my daily routine. I highly recommend her to anyone wanting a positive and enlightened change to their daily routine of health, life, and well being."
