                Happy Earth Day! Although every day should be a day that we are thinking about how our life and actions can improve the wellbeing of our planet, this is a special day dedicated to doing just that! Earth Day is also a perfect opportunity to simply raise awareness for how much our planet needs us to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is it important? Well, much like our bodies, if we don’t take care of our environment, then it can no longer provide for us as well as it should. The Earth is our home and will only be our home if make the commitment to take care of it and preserve it.  With the rise of technology, we are no longer in tune with Nature and all that it provides for us.  We are a consumer society that buys and disposes of materials every day and the planet is running out of places to put that meaningless junk.  We have also polluted the plant so much and we are the ones that are overloaded with toxins and disease because of it.  Bettering the environment doesn’t have to be a huge, daunting task. You can make a difference just by making small changes in your daily habits. Here are a few ways you can help better the planet- today, and every day.
            </p>



            <ol>
                <li>Recycle- whatever you can, whenever you can.  Put a separate bag under your sink just for recycling.</li>
                <li>
                    Reuse glass containers you buy at the store.  They make for perfect storage for many kitchen and even beauty items. I even carry tea on-the-go with them!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don’t rinse the dishes off before you put them in the dishwasher- they get soapy in there anyways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use cold water instead of hot in the washer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of using paper towel to clean, use old shirts and clothing as rags then just wash and reuse when you are done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hang dry your clothes- this is actually preserves the quality of your clothing anyways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ride your bike or walk when you can.  You just might find that a bike ride home from work in the fresh air was exactly what you needed to wind down from the day!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go meatless once a week.  Try out some new recipes with organic sprouted tofu, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use cruise control and keep your tires properly inflated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring your own reusable bags when grocery shopping...and save on your groceries by doing so!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Buy local - the only way we can make healthy food more accessible and affordable is by supporting and helping local farmers thrive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn about the brands and companies you are buying from and whether you support their mission and believe in the products they carry.  What is in their food? How are their products created and what packaging are they using?  Often, when you know the truth about how the item was created or what is actually in it, you may not want to buy it anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reuse the same cups instead of using a disposable one every day.  Bring in your own coffee mug or glass to work.  Find one with an inspirational message to motivate you!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn how to make your own lotions, makeup, household cleaners and other items.  It usually involves just a few ingredients and will save a ton of money!  I love <i>googling</i> new natural ways to make things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go paperless with your billing.
                </li>
                <br>
                <strong>LAST but most certainly NOT LEAST</strong><br>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Be MINDFUL of each purchase you make.  Rather than impulse buying and feeling guilty later, think about the life span of whatever it is you are buying, what is in it and how it was created.  Impulse shopping comes from an unconscious need to satisfy underlying physical or emotional needs.  Once you identify what that is, you can create more effective ways to satisfy those needs such as having dinner with a friend or spending some time outside in nature.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These are just a few ways to get you thinking, but I’d love to hear some of your favorite ways that you better the earth.
            </p>
