      <h3>Take Charge!</h3>
      <p>
        You do not have to blow your healthy food plan when eating away from home.
      </p>

      <h3>Some Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Plan ahead.</li>
        <li> Watch portion size.</li>
        <li> Know the best “eat-out” foods.</li>
        <li> Include foods you love when you can.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Before you go out make sure you think ahead.</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Choose a restaurant with plenty of menu choices.</li>
        <li>Use apps like HealthyOut to ﬁnd healthy restaurant options or just do a quick google search for healthy, local or organic restaurants around you. A good online resource is www.happycow.net </li>
        <li>Go online to preview the menu, or call and ask what healthy choices they offer. Look for foods that are “lean,” “light” or “heart healthy.” Generally, gluten-free dishes tend to be on the healthier side as well.  </li>
        <li>If you have a gathering or celebration to go to, eat a snack before you go out. It helps, believe me. Do not wait until you are starving, you will end up overeating.  </li>
        <li>Know how to choose smart amounts of food you like and add in vegetables to take the edge of your hunger. A good strategy is to order a side of raw or steamed vegetables right away.  </li>
        <li>Try new foods to make eating out more fun and to add variety to your diet. </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>When you get there make sure to eat small portions.</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Split a meal with someone else.</li>
        <li>Ask for half a portion or order a child’s portion.</li>
        <li>Eat part of your food and have the waiter box the other half right away to take home.</li>
        <li>Order sauces and salad dressings on the side use just a little. Often people do not realize how much fat and calories are in dressings. Avoid creamy or sugary dressings and instead order oil,vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon.</li>
        <li>Customize your order. Ask for a side salad or steamed vegetables instead of heavy breads, buns and pastas. Ask for extra vegetables and less meat.</li>
        <li>Hydrate throughout the day and before your meal. Drink a full glass of water right before. I guarantee you will get full much quicker.</li>
        <li>Chew your food and eat slowly. This helps you digest it better and the motion of chewing sends a signal to your stomach that you are getting full so you eat less.</li>
        <li>Build your own tasty meal “to order".</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Look for more of these on the menu:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Salads: Lots of dark leafy greens and lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, broccoli, and other fresh fruits and vegetables. Grilled salmon, tuna, salmon, hard-boiled eggs and nuts make great add-ins. Top with lemon juice and a little oil.</li>
        <li>Protein: Grilled sautéed or baked organic lean meats such as chicken and turkey. Avoid anything that is crusted or in heavy sauce.</li>
        <li>Light tuna, salmon or white ﬁsh</li>
        <li>Broccoli, carrots, peppers, green beans, cauliﬂower, Brussel sprouts, asparagus or baked beans as side or main dishes.</li>
        <li>Whole grains such as brown or wild rice, oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, quinoa, millet,</li>
        <li>Baked, boiled or roasted.</li>
        <li>Steamed rice or fresh fruit.</li>
        <li>Olive-oil vinaigrette, broth, wine, squeezed lemon juice, mustard, salsa or other low-fat sauces.</li>
        <li>Plain, sparkling or mineral water with a lemon slice or tea (hot or unsweetened). Stevia is a good alternative to sugar.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Avoid these foods:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Cheese, croutons, bacon bits, coleslaw, potato or pasta salads made with creamy dressing.</li>
        <li>Ground beef, steak, ribs, bacon, sausages, hot dogs and deli meats.</li>
        <li>Shark, swordﬁsh, king mackerel and tileﬁsh. These all have high levels of mercury.</li>
        <li>Vegetables that are breaded cooked in butter or covered with sauce.</li>
        <li>Reﬁned grains such as white rice or bread, corn bread, grits, ﬂour and corn tortillas, crackers, pretzels, noodles, spaghetti, corn ﬂakes and macaroni. They have a very glycemic index causing the blood sugar to spike. </li>
        <li>French fries, potato chips, home fries, twice baked or potato salad.</li>
        <li>Onion rings or mayonnaise-based salads.</li>
        <li>Gravy, cheese, cream, butter and meat sauces.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise, tartar sauce, “secret” sauce, butter and sour cream.</li>
        <li>Croissants, biscuits, garlic bread or doughnuts.</li>
        <li>Sodas or sugary, ﬂavored coffee drinks.</li>
        <li>Cake, pie, cookies, cheesecake, ice cream. Eat just a little and split with friends.</li>
      </ul>
