                Intuitive eating is an approach that bridges the connection between the food you eat, and your mind and body.  You become your own nutrition expert.  It’s one of the best ways to separate physical from emotional feelings and signals and help you foster and build body intuition.  It also helps you finally let go of addictions to foods like sugar and caffeine.  You don’t have to constantly worry about the food you eat or that you have fallen off the healthy eating bandwagon and don’t know how to get back on.  If you have a history of chronic dieting or strict “healthy” rules about eating that just seem to control your life, this approach can really help you gain the freedom back around food.

            <p>

                Intuitive eating is one of the main principles that has made a huge difference in my life and that I coach others on when it comes to changing their relationship with food.  I used to binge eat…a lot, and especially sugar.  I would eat a ton of food late at night then wake up groggy and instantly reach for the caffeine to pick me back up, which then led to caffeine addiction as well.  My digestive system was a mess because I was constantly overeating, never giving it a break, so it became taxed.  I couldn’t digest food regularly anymore which then led to me being very strict, only eating certain foods because I was so afraid that whatever I ate would make me feel horrible.  I was depriving myself of the joy to live and eat, which still led to late night binges.  So, what changed?  I decided to reject the diet mentality and make peace with food…and I did this through intuitive eating.

                When is the last time you listened to your body? The best nutrition plan is guided by body signals.  Some great questions to begin to practice intuitive eating with your own body include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Do you remember what you ate yesterday or the day before?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you pay attention to how you feel after meals?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you consciously think about how you’ll feel before you eat something?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How long after eating do you become hungry again?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What type of energy do you get from snacks and meals?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Intuitive eating can be complex and takes time and support.  Start small and begin to just take notice of how you feel before and after you eat.
