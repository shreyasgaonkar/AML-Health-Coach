    <h3>What is health coaching?</h3>
    <p>A health coach is an expert in the process of health behavior change. Health coaches work in partnership with their clients to help them set goals and take action to achieve and sustain health-supporting behaviors.</p>

    <h3>What kinds of issues can health coaching address?</h3>
    <p>Burnout and lack of energy, poor eating habits, making health fit in a busy schedule, mental performance, weight gain or inability to lose weight, sinus issues, digestion, stress management, autoimmune disease, diabetes and other chronic illness, just to name a few.</p>

    <h3>So how does health coaching work?</h3>
    <p>After you have had your consultation, and youâ€™ve decided that coaching is for you, you will fill out a complete health assessment. This assessment will tell you and me, your coach, where you are right now.  In our first session, we fully explore your vision of you and what health goals you are looking to achieve.  Each session after that, you will choose a focus and we will explore where you are, where you want to be, and figure out how to move forward with achievable goals.</p>

    <h3>How long do clients work with you?</h3>
    <p>It varies, but I typically encourage clients to commit to a minimum of 1 months where we would meet weekly, and sessions usually last 50 minutes. Research shows that six months is necessary to create lasting behavior change.  This time frame allows my clients to reach and sustain goals through small steps and repetition.</p>

    <h3>How much does it cost</h3>
    <p>Prices from $100 - $124 a session depending on your program.  If you sign up for 3 or 6 month program, your initial consultation is free.</p>

    <h3>What other services do you offer?</h3>
    <p>
      I offer a variety of services and health products including:
      <ul>
        <li>Group coaching
        </li>
        <li>  Wellness seminars</li>
        <li>Reiki</li>
        <li>  Detox programs</li>
        <li>ALCAT Food Sensitivity Testing</li>
        <li>Corporate Wellness</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>How is coaching different from a nutritionist or other health providers?</h3>
    <p>Nutritionists give you the list of foods to eat or not to eat. Most people already know this.  Therapists do not provide an end in sight, and there is no linking of mood and diet.  Doctors do not work on the root cause of the symptom, but instead decide which pill to give or surgery to undergo.  Coaching addresses the <i style="font-weight:bold">ROOT CAUSE</i> of the issue.  Coach and client work together to identify the change that needs to be made, create a vision for what is possible, co-create a game plan to make it happen and provides the accountability and support to stick with it.</p>
