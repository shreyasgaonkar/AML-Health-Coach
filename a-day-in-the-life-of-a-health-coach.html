      <p>
        Starting your own business as a holistic health coach is vastly different from the typical nine-to- five job.

        It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once you settle into a routine it can be one of the most

        rewarding careers. If you are curious as to what a day in the life of a health coach looks like, then let me

        fill you in.</p>
        <p>

          I start each day with my own self-care routine, which includes a mindful walk around the park with my

          fitness dog, juicing fresh vegetables and fruit, and five minutes of stretching. In order to be a successful

          health coach, you have to be healthy, happy, well rested, in balance, and live the life you preach to

          others.</p>
          <p>

            Next, I look at my calendar to see what appointments and events I have coming up that week. I also

            begin my day in the right direction by writing my top three goals of the day, top three things I am

            grateful for, and top three successes from the day before. This exercise keeps me motivated and in a

            positive frame of mind. You are ultimately in charge of your business and the direction you want it to go.

            The clearer your intentions and vision for your practice the more likely it is that you will succeed.</p>
            <p>

              I spend the first few hours in the morning doing administrative duties such as catching up on emails,

              checking social networking sites, creating materials for my programs, etc. This time is set aside for

              focused and uninterrupted work. In the afternoon, I may have a few one-on- one clients, which I either

              meet in person or coach over the phone.</p>
              <p>

                I reserve my evenings for networking events and workshops. Putting yourself out there and talking to

                people is crucial to building a successful coaching business. I also make sure to exercise at least five days

                a week, which I will work into the evenings and weekends, when I do not have events scheduled.</p>
                <p>

                  I decompress and wrap up my day by cooking a nutritious meal and sitting down to eat without

                  distraction. From there, I cuddle up to a good inspirational book for at least an hour before bed to help

                  my mind and body transition to rest mode. To ensure that there is a balance of give and take, you need

                  to create a support system that works for you - a way to recharge your battery and discharge stress.
